      <h3>What is Fizzy Sums?</h3>
      <p>Fizzy Sums is a number game that is similar to kakuro or sudoku that focuses on basic arithmetic. 
        The goal of the game is to satisfy all the equations in the rows and columns such that each number 1-9 is used 
        exactly once. There are many forms of this game available on the internet under different names, but Fizzy Sums 
        follows these guidelines:
        <ul>
          <li>Order of operations (PEMDAS) applies.</li>
          <li>Basic fractions may occur within the equation (1/4, 1/2, 2/3, etc.).</li>
          <li>Negative numbers may occur within the equation.</li>
        </ul>
        For example:
        <ul>
          <li>9+8*5=49 because you evaluate multiplication (8*5) before addition (9+8). So you get 9+8*5=9+40=49.</li>
          <li>2/8*4=1 is valid because even though you get the fraction 1/4 when dividing 2/8, after multiplying by 4 
          you end up with a whole number. Only whole numbers occur after the = sign.</li>
          <li>3-4*1=-1 is valid even though a negative number occurs. Some other forms of this game found on the internet 
          may not use negative numbers but Fizzy Sums does.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why Fizzy Sums?</h3>
      <p>I made Fizzy Sums as a way to practice creating web applications using React JS. It is completely open-source and 
        you can view the source code in its entirety <a href="https://github.com/fordchastain/fizzy-sums">here</a>. If 
        you are interested, feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests. If I feel the change you made improved 
        the project, then I will happily merge it into the master branch!</p>
